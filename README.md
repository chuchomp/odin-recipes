The following project consists of setting up a fully functional cooking recipes website.

To fully complete such task, all the knowledge learned in the previous lessons regarding HTML documents' structure will be put into action.

Hopefully, this undertaking will aid to cement the necessary skills for becoming a professional web developer.

Thank you for reading.

Note to self: Do not falter, I belive in you.
